# DOS clock

> deal with DOS dates and times in Node.js

DOS dates and times are used in the zip file format (and possibly other places).
They're pretty compact.

This library just converts from a number (unsigned integer) to a usable data
structure, or from a JS date to the same. This way you can turn a DOS date
number into a JS date, or vice versa.

## usage

see `test.js`
