# DOS clock

> deal with DOS dates and times in Node.js

DOS dates and times are used in the zip file format (and possibly other places).
They're pretty compact.

Right now, this library just converts from a number (unsigned integer) to a
usable data structure. Better things in the future. Maybe.

## usage

see `test.js`
